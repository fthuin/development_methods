    \section{Requirement issues and adopted corrections}

    \paragraph{Requirement 1} After the purchase of gasoline, the gas pump
    reports the number of gallons purchased to the GSCS.\@ The GSCS updates the
    remaining inventory.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 2} After the purchase of gasoline, the gas pump
    reports the dollar amount of the purchase to the GSCS.\@ The maximum value of
    a purchase is \$ 999.99. The GSCS then causes the gas pump interface to
    query the customer as to payment type.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 3} The customer may choose to be billed at the time
    of purchase, or to be sent a monthly bill. If billing is to be done at time
    of purchase, the gas pump interface queries the customer as to whether
    payment will be made by cash or credit card. If the purchase is to be placed
    on a monthly bill, the gas pump interface instructs the customer to see the
    cashier. If an invalid or no response is received, the GSCS bills at the
    time of purchase.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 4} If the customer has selected to pay at the time of
    purchase, he or she can choose to pay by cash or credit card. If the
    customer selects cash, the gas pump interface instructs the customer to see
    the cashier. If the customer selects credit card, the gas pump interface
    instructs the customer to swipe his or her credit card through the credit
    card reader. If an invalid or no selection is made, the GSCS will default
    to credit card payment.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 5} If payment is to be made by credit card, then the
    card reader sends the credit card number to the GSCS.\@ If the GSCS receives
    an invalid card number, then a message is sent to the gas pump interface
    asking the customer to swipe the card through the card reader again. After
    the account number is obtained, the account number and purchase price are
    sent to the credit card system, and the GSCS and gas pump interface are
    reset to their initial state. The purchase price sent can be up to \$ 10000.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 6} The cashier is responsible for accepting the
    customer's payment and making change, if necessary. When payment is
    complete, the cashier indicates this on the cashier's interface. The GSCS
    and the gas pump interface then return to the initial state.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 7} If payment is to be made by monthly bill, the
    purchase price is displayed on the cashier's interface. The cashier
    selects an option from the cashier's interface, alerting the GSCS that the
    payment will be placed on a monthly bill. The GSCS then prompts the cashier
    to enter the billing account number.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 8} The customer must give the billing account number
    to the cashier, who then enters it at the cashier's interface. If a valid
    billing account number is entered, then the billing account number, purchase
    price, and a brief description of the type of transaction is logged. If an
    invalid billing account number is entered, an error message is displayed
    and the cashier is prompted to enter it again. The cashier must also have
    the option to cancel the operation, in which case the cashier's interface
    reverts to showing the purchase price and the cashier can again either
    receive cash or indicate that monthly billing should be used.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 9} To pay a monthly bill, the customer must send
    the payment along with the billing account number. The cashier enters
    monthly payments by first selecting the appropriate option from the
    cashier's interface. The GSCS then sends a message to the cashier's
    interface. The GSCS then sends a message to the cashier's interface
    prompting the cashier to enter the billing account number, the amount
    remitted, and the type of payment. If any of these pieces of information
    are not entered or are invalid, payment cannot be processed; an error
    message will be displayed, and the cashier's interface will be returned
    to the previous screen. If the type of payment is credit card, the credit
    card account number must also be entered, and then the paper credit card
    receipt will be photocopied and stored with the rest of the year's receipts.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Requirement 10} Unless otherwise specified, if the GSCS receives
    invalid input it will send an error message to the cashier's interface.
    The cashier will be expected to take appropriate action, which may
    involve shutting the system down for maintenance.

    \begin{framed}
    \end{framed}

    \paragraph{Non-functional requirement 1} The system must always respond to
    customer input within 5 minutes.

    \paragraph{Non-functional requirement 2} The system should be easy to
    extend, so that if necessary another payment option (e.g.\ bankcard) can be
    added with minimal effort.
