\section{Conclusion}

In this assignment, we did our best to apply the theorical methods of
software development. We saw how important it was to have good
requirements to be able to build properly the rest of the structure of
the system. We also had to work iteratively because at first we missed
some methods or data needed and we had to add it while doing the next
diagrams. We limited our diagrams to our understanding of the
requirements, everything could be more complete and coherent if the
requirements were, but we had to work with partial information such that
everything might not seem clear from an external point-of-view.
