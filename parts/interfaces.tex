Although we know that the model made during the lab session only describe the
parts directly related to the system and suggest that inputs and outputs are
expressed w.r.t the system, we prefer to be as complete as possible with some
unrelated parts (such as the customer that is only acting on the system through
interfaces) which causes that input/ouput are expressed w.r.t each entity and
\textit{not} to the system.

\subsection{Credit card system}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the GSCS

\paragraph{Receives input from} the GSCS (credit card account number: text)

\paragraph{Sends output to} the GSCS (amount of dollars: positive float up to
999.99)

\subsection{Credit card reader}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the customer, the GSCS

\paragraph{Receives input from} the customer (a credit card related to an
account number)

\paragraph{Sends output to} the GSCS (a credit card account number: text or
an invalid token)

\subsection{Gas pump}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the customer, the GSCS

\paragraph{Receives input from} the customer (amount of gallons: positive float)

\paragraph{Sends output to} the GSCS (an amout of gallons: positive float, an
amount of dollars: positive float up to 999.99)

\subsection{Gas pump interface}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the customer, the GSCS

\paragraph{Receives input from} the GSCS (list of options: list, messages: text,
reset instruction), the customer (option: list index)

\paragraph{Sends output to} the GSCS (option number from the customer: positive
integer), the customer (list of options: list, message: text)

\subsection{Customer}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the cashier, the credit card reader, the gas pump
interface

\paragraph{Receives input from} the gas pump interface (list of options: list,
message: text), the cashier (change after cash payment: positive float)

\paragraph{Sends output to} the gas pump interface (an option: a list index),
the cashier (billing account number: text, cash: positive float)

\subsection{Cashier}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the customer, the cashier's interface

\paragraph{Receives input from} the customer (cash payment: positive float,
instructions), the cashier's interface (message: text)

\paragraph{Send output to} the customer (change: positive float), the cashier's
interface (input, instructions)

\subsection{Cashier's interface}

\paragraph{Interactions with} the cashier, the GSCS

\paragraph{Receives input from} the cashier (valid account: boolean, inputs,
cancel instruction), the GSCS (message:text, prompt window)

\paragraph{Send output to} the cashier (message: text), the GSCS (monthly
billing instruction, purchase finished instruction, cashier's input)

\subsection{GSCS}

\paragraph{Interactions with} Credit card system, gas pump, gas pump
interface, cashier's interface, credit card reader, cashier

\paragraph{Receives input from} the credit card system (reimbursement:
positive float), the gas pump (amount of gallons purchased: positive
float), the gas pump interface (option choose: positive integer),
cashier's interface (cashier's input), credit card reader (credit card
account number: text), cashier (maintenance operation)

\paragraph{Send output to} the credit card system (payment information),
the gas pump interface (list of payment type: List), the cashier's interface (list of options: List, messsage: text)
