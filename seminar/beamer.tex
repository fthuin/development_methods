\section{Fallacies 3: People}

\subsection{Fact 1}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 1}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
        The most important factor in software work is \textit{not} the tools and
        techniques used by the programmers, but rather the quality of the
        programmers themselves.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 2}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 2}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    The best programmers are up to 28 times better than the worst programmers,
    according to \enquote{individual differences} research. Given that
    their pay is never commensurate, they are the biggest bargains in the
    software field.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 3}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 3}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Adding people to a late project makes it later.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 4}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 4}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    The working environment has a profound impact on productivity and product
    quality.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Fallacies 6: Estimation}

\subsection{Fact 8}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 8}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    One of the two most common causes of runaway projects is poor estimation.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 9}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 9}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Most software estimates are performed at the beginning of the life cycle.
    This makes sense until we realize that estimates are obtained before the
    requirements are defined and thus before the problem is understood.
    Estimation, therefore, usually occurs at the wrong time.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 10}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 10}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Most software estimates are made either by upper management or by marketing,
    not by the people who will build the software or their managers. Estimation
    is, therefore, done by the wrong people.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 11}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 11}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Software estimates are rarely adjusted as the project proceeds. Thus those
    estimates done at the wrong time by the wrong people are usually not
    corrected.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 12}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 12}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Since estimates are so faulty, there is little reason to be concerned when
    software projects do not meet estimated targets. But everyone is concerned
    anyway.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 13}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 13}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    There is a disconnect between management and their programmers. In one
    research study of a project that failed to meet its estimates and was seen
    by its management as a failure, the technical participants saw it as the
    most successful project they had ever worked on.
    \end{block}
    Why management consider it as a failure?
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item 27 months instead of 14.
    	\item 130\% for the sotfware.
    	\item 800\% for the firmware.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Fact 13}
	Why programmer consider it a success?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Final product was complete.
		\item Developing was a technical challenge.
		\item Freedom given by the management.
	\end{itemize}
	The main problem is to define what's constitute a succesful project.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 14}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 14}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    The answer to a feasibility study is almost always \enquote{yes.}
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
    		\item Developer tends to be too optimistic.
    		\item Illusion that everything will go without problem.
    		\item Time frame between the answer and discovery of its falseness too long.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Reuse}

\subsection{Fact 15}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 15}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Reuse-in-the-small (libraries of subroutines) began nearly 50 years ago and
    is a well-solved problem.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
    		\item First libraries of subroutines in the mid-1950s.
    		\item Math functions, String handlers,sorts,\ldots
    		\item Succesful idea which try to be expanded.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 16}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 16}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Reuse-in-the-large (components) remains a mostly unsolved problem, even
    though everyone agrees it is important and desirable.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
    		\item More difficult to build a large reusable component than a small one.
    		\item Two points of view:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Futur of the field, where program are an aggregate of components.
    			\item Nearly possible to generalize enough.
    		\end{itemize} 		
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Fact 16}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It depend on sofware diversity, is there enough common problem across project?
		\item \textit{Not-Invented-Here} phenomenon
		\item A lack of skill?
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 17}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 17}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Reuse-in-the-large works best in families of related systems and thus is
    domain-dependent. This narrows the potential applicability of
    reuse-in-the-large.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 18}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 18}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    There are two \enquote{rules of three} in reuse: (a) It is three times as
    difficult to build reusable components as single use components, and (b) a
    reusable component should be tried out in three different applications
    before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 19}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 19}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Modification of reused code is particularly error-prone. If more than 20 to
    25 percent of a component is to be revised, it is more efficient and
    effective to rewrite it from scratch.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fact 20}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Fact 20}
    \begin{block}{Fact}
    Design pattern reuse is one solution to the problems inherent in code reuse.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
